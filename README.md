Credit Risk Analysis 
The purpose of this assignment is to use the lending data given and create logistical regression model predicting healthy and non-healthy loans based off the data given. 
The logistic regression models were able to predict the healthy loans with very high accuracy with precision and recall scores of 100% and 99% respectively. As for non-healthy loans the models were still able to predict with high accuracy but to a lesser extent with precision of 85% and recall of 99%. 
The models are thus reliable for such a purpose with a greater confidence in its ability to predict healthy loans.
